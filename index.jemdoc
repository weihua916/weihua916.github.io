I am currently working at [https://www.perplexity.ai/ Perplexity AI] to build an AI answer engine.

Previously, I worked at [https://kumo.ai/ Kumo AI] to productionize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on modern relational databases.
I received a Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science at Stanford, advised by Prof. [https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/ Jure Leskovec]. I built machine learning theory\/methods\/benchmarks for graph-structured data, aiming to improve diverse real-world applications, such as recommender systems, drug\/material discovery, and weather forecasting. I am excited about applying (graph) machine learning to solve interesting and important real-world problems. \n 

I received a B.E. in Mathematical Engineering in 2016, and an M.S. in Computer Science in 2018, both from the University of Tokyo, where I worked with Prof. [http://www.ms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sugi/index.html Masashi Sugiyama] on machine learning and Prof. [http://hirosuke.mydns.jp/ Hirosuke Yamamoto] on information theory.
I also worked with Prof. [http://www.nactem.ac.uk/tsujii/home-tsujii/atlab.html Jun'ichi Tsujii] and Prof. [http://researchmap.jp/hideki_mima/ Hideki Mima] on natural language processing.
